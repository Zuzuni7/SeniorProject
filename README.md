### About Mibos

This is an health tracking application that allows the user to take care of an avatar
and in turn take care of themselves. The application focuses theuser on taking care
of ones body, mind, and spirit by setting personal goals and sticking to them. This 
is my very first Flutter project. I am learning as I go and many changes could and 
probably should be made to the existing code. I appreciate any feedback and any tips
and tricks to help make this app useful and more effective.
